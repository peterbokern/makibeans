## 1. Introduction

The Makibeans Web API is a Java Spring Boot backend for a coffee beans webshop that supports management of products and
categories. In addition, products can be dynamically enriched with attributes and variants. The application is secured
with JWT authentication and uses a relational PostgreSQL database. The API supports multiple user roles (admin and
customer) and provides features such as user management, product management, filtering, search, and image upload.

**Technologies used:**

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.3
- PostgreSQL
- Maven 3.9+
- JWT (io.jsonwebtoken v0.11.5)
- MapStruct (v1.6.3)
- JPA & Hibernate
- Spring Security
- dotenv (spring-dotenv v4.0.0)
- Swagger (springdoc-openapi v2.7.0)
- Apache Tika (v3.1.0)
- Lombok (v1.18.30)

---

## 2. Requirements

To run this web API, you'll need:

- Java JDK 21
- Relational database: PostgreSQL (currently configured on port 5433, but you can change it in the `.env` file and `application.properties`)
- Postman (for API testing)
- A `.env` file with secrets including database username and password and SSL (see step 3)
- Maven 3.9+ (or the Maven wrapper `mvnw` included in the project)

> All secrets in the `.env` file are automatically loaded into `application.properties` using the Spring dotenv
> integration. You can reference them using `${}` placeholders such as `${db.username}`.

---

## 3. Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Database

1. Open a terminal on your machine.
2. Start PostgreSQL (e.g., via Postgres.app or pgAdmin).
3. Connect to an existing database <database_name> (e.g., `students`) using the following command:

```bash
psql -p 5433 -d <database_name>
```

4. Create a new database user the application will use to connect:

```sql
CREATE USER <db_username> WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';
```

5. Create a new database and assign the user as the owner:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE makibeans OWNER <db_username>;
```

6. Grant all privileges to the user:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE makibeans TO <db_username>;
```

7. Exit the session:

```sql
\q
```

> Replace `<db_username>` and `<db_password>` with the values from your `.env` file. This user is only used for
> connecting the application to the database. Application users (like admin and regular_user) are created automatically
> when the app starts.


### Step 3: Generate SSL Certificate (only required once)

In Spring Boot, HTTPS can be enabled using an SSL certificate. For development purposes, we use a self-signed
certificate that we generate ourselves. You can also disable SSL in `application.properties` for testing.

Open a terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias certificate -keystore certificate.jks -storepass p4ssw0rd -validity 365 -keysize 4096 -storetype pkcs12
```

After answering a few informational prompts, this will generate a certificate file called `certificate.jks`.  
Place this file in your project directory â€” for example, inside the `resources` folder.

In your `application.properties` file, add the following configuration:

```properties
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:certificate.jks
server.ssl.key-store-type=pkcs12
server.ssl.key-store-password=${keystorepass}
server.ssl.key-password=${keypass}
server.ssl.key-alias=certificate
server.port=8443
```
> Note: The password for the keystore and key are kept in the `.env` file.
---

### Step 3: Create `.env` file

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
db_username=<db_username>
db_password=<db_password>
jwt_secret=<your_jwt_secret>
server_ssl_key_store_password=keystorepass
server_ssl_key_password=keypass
```

> Note : for the JWT key, A good practice is to use a randomly generated string of at least 32 characters. For example, you can use a secure password generator to create a string with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

---

### Step 4: Start the Application

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API will run at:

```
https://localhost:8443
```

Accept the self-signed certificate if prompted.

---

## 4. Test Users and Roles

| Username                 | Password     | Role  |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------|
| maki_admin               | maki_admin   | ADMIN |
| regular_user@example.com | regular_user | USER  |

These users are automatically created in `DataInitializer.java` when the application starts.

---

## 5. Postman Collection

The Postman collection is included as `makibeans.postman_collection.json`.  
You'll find it in the `/postman/` subfolder of the project. This collection contains a script that logs in as the admin
user and stores the resulting JWT token as api_key in the Postman environment. This token can then be used to
authenticate and try out the API endpoints that require authorization.

### To import:

1. Open Postman
2. Click `Import`
3. Select the JSON file

---

## 6. REST Endpoints and JSON Examples

The following examples show a selection of commonly used endpoints.  
For the full and most up-to-date list of available routes, required fields, and access permissions, refer to the Swagger
API documentation (see section 7).

### Authentication

```
POST /auth/register
```

```json
{
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "password": "user123"
}
```

```
POST /auth/login
```

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "user123"
}
```

*Response includes a JWT token.*

---

### Products

```
GET /products
```

*(Public - no token required)*  
Returns a list of products including variants, prices, images and attributes.

```json

      },
      {
        "templateName": "Roast",
        "value": "Dark"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

```
POST /products
```

*(Requires ADMIN role)*  
Adds a new product:

```json
{
  "name": "Espresso Bonen",
  "description": "Intens en krachtig",
  "categoryId": 1
}
```

---

### Upload Product Image

```

```

*(multipart/form-data, requires ADMIN token)*

---

### Filtering and Searching

```
GET /products?query=espresso&sort=price&order=asc
```

---

## 7. Swagger API Documentation

The full API documentation is available via Swagger (OpenAPI).

Once the application is running, visit:

```
https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html
```

There you'll find:

- All available endpoints
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Required and optional parameters
- Possible responses
- JWT authorization settings

Swagger also allows you to test endpoints live in the browser.

## 8. Running and Building the Project

### Using the Maven Wrapper (recommended)

You can start the project using the Maven wrapper (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`). This allows the project to run without
requiring Maven to be installed system-wide.

Example:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Windows:

```cmd
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

---

### Build JAR (packaged application)

With wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw package
```

Without wrapper:

```bash
mvn package
```

---

### Run Application

With wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Without wrapper:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### Drop Database (optional)

```sql
DROP DATABASE makibeans;
DROP USER <db_username>;
```

---

### Build Project without Running

With wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

Without wrapper:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

> Note: Ensure the `.env` file is correctly filled in and that your certificate is present in `resources/` if using
> HTTPS. For testing purposes, you can temporarily disable SSL in `application.properties`.
